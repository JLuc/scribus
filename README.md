Scribus Git Repository
======================

This is the official Scribus Community Git repository

Branches
--------

* master - main development branch
* release - release only branch. It will be empty until 1.5.0 is branched for pre-release stabilization.
* svn - only used to synchronize the Git repository with the Subversion repository. Do not commit to it, only merge from it.

All other branches are short-lived feature or hotfix branches according to the Git Flow model http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
